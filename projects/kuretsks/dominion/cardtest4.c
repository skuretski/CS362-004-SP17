 *			See dominion.h for more information
 *		-- Player has Great Hall in hand
 *		-- Player has 3 Victory points.
 *	Desired Post-condition:
 *		-- Player gains 1 card.
 *		-- Player gains 1 action.
 *		-- Player gains 1 Victory point for total of 4 VP. 
 *
 *  **NOTE: this unit test assumes function scoreFor() calculates
 *  score correctly with great_hall.
