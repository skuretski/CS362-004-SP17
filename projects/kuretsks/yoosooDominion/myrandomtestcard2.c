 * CS362-400, Spring 2017
 * Assignment 4: Random Testers
 * May 8, 2017
 *
 * Description: This is a random tester for the Village card. Randomized entities:
 * 	1. Initial Game State
 * 		a. Num of players (2-4) randomized.
 * 		b. Kingdom Cards (adventurer - treasure_map) randomized.
 * 			i. If Kingdom Card under test is not included, then it is put in
 * 				random location in Kingdom Card array.
 * 		c. Pseudo-randomized seed (see rngs.h)
 * 	2. WhoseTurn
 * 		a. Randomly selected based upon number of players in gameState
 * 	3. Player's hand
 * 		a. Randomly selected from Kingdom Cards
 * 		b. Card under test is put in random location in hand.
 * 		c. Size is randomized (min/max in mytesthelper.h)
 * 	4. Deck
 * 		a. Deck size is randomized (min and max defined in mytesthelper.h)
 * 		b. Deck itself is randomized
 * 	5. Discard
 * 		a. Discard size randomized (min/max in mytesthelper.h)
 * 		b. Discard cards randomized
 * 	6. NumActions and NumBuys
 * 		a. Number is randomized (min/max in mytesthelper.h)
 * 	7. PHASE IS ALWAYS SET TO ACTION
 *
 * 	The randomized state is set and then Village is played.
 * 	The Oracle will check if the post-conditions are correct.
 * ***********************************************************************************
 * A Village card should:
 *	1. playVillage function does not consume an action. This is done in function
 *	   playCard() which is not under test here.
 *	2. playVillage should put Village card into playedCards pile and
 *	   increase playedCardsCount by 1.
 *	3. Number of actions should increase by 2.
 *	4. Player should draw one card from deck and put into hand.
 *		a. Hand Count is increased by 1.
 *		b. Deck Count is decreased by 1.
 *		c. Drawn card should be put into hand array and removed from deck
 *			array
 *	5. State that should NOT change:
		Discard Count, Discard cards, whoseTurn, numPlayers, supplyCount, embargoToken,
		outpostPlayed, outpostTurn, phase, coins, numBuys.
