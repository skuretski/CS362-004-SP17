/*	This unit test is designed to test the Adventurer card
 *	implementation.
 *
 *	Card Effect: Reveal cards from your deck until you reveal
 *	2 Treasure cards. Put those Treasure cards into your hand and
 *	discard the other revealed cards.
 *
 *	Desired Pre-condition:
 *		-- 	struct gameState game which holds game information.
 *		  	See dominion.h for full description of struct.
 *	Desired Post-condition:
 *		--	Current player receives two treasure cards into
 *			current hand if 2 treasure cards are available for draw.
 *		--  Current player receives one treasure card into
 *		    current hand if 1 treasure card are available for draw.
 *		--	Current player plays Adventurer and discards all other non-Treasure cards
 *		    which were drawn to find treasure card.
